My first contact with a computer was in the mid 80's with my brother's [Amstrad CPC464](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC), it mainly was used to play and occasionally write some lines of code in [BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC).

In this humble blog, which is just a small island in the ocean of Internet, I try to state my view on `Agile Development Methodologies` (especially software), `Team Management`, `Software`... I don't have more pretension than share my impressions based in my personal experience that every day is nurtured thanks to many colleagues and friends who are into this world of software development. And why not say that this blog helps me to feel like a writer.

Well, I'm David Fernández González, gijonés (from Gijón), asturiano (from Asturias), Spanish, European, Earthman and Computer Engineer degree.
