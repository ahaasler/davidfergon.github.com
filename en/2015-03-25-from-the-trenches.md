The clock alarm rings. The ear is awakened abruptly. Then you turn the switch and your view is the one affected. All your senses wake up after a shorter night than normal.

It's Monday and it's time tto come back to the grind at the office. But your office, like many others, is not always office with tables, chairs and computers. Your office is a battlefield, full of: landmines, allies, enemies, inept sergeants, clumsy recruits, heroes who daily try to fight his own war.

Everywhere we find small personal stories full of reality, full of nuances that make us unique and different in our own way, and each one has its own way.

** In your office you form your own alliance, by affinity, by ways of seeing life**. You don't must be equals, because you can always disagree, in fact you must disagree to enrich each other, the debate leads to reflection, reflection to knowledge and knowledge to wisdom. But not everyone is open to hear another point of view and there is where arise your own enemies within the people that should be your allies.

> "Corrects the wise and he will be wiser, corrects a fool and he will be your enemy." (Chinese proverb)

But it is what it is. No bones about it, do not get depressed, do not enter in any self-destructive spiral. You can't please everyone, and you neither have to seek it. ** Live without rancor and your life will be much easier and pleasant ** because in this life we ​​are only on borrowed and time is so fleeting that it's not worth wasting time on trivialities.

So get up, take your own rifle and face your day with courage and honor together your allies, your companions, the people which may even become friends outside of work, but all we can assert without fear of error is that they never stop being your comrades from the trenches.
